proc file system (procfs) in Linux
----------------------------------
It is a virtual file system created on when the system boots and is dissolved at the time of system shutdown.

It contains useful information about the processes that are currently running.

The proc file system also provides a communication medium between kernel space and user space.

To List all the files and directories under the /proc directory
$ls -l /proc

Detailed information like permissions, ownership, size, and time of modifications.


***To view the information of a specific process assigned a PID***

$ps -aux

$ls -ltr /proc/3151

$ls -ltr /proc/31154/status



***Directories in /proc in Linux***
Directory			Description
---------			-----------
/proc/PID/cmdline	Command line arguments

/proc/PID/cpu		Current and last cpu in which it was executed.

/proc/PID/cwd		Link to the current working directory.

/proc/PID/environ	Values of environment variables.

/proc/PID/exe		Link to the executable of this process.

/proc/PID/fd		Directory, which contains all file descriptors.

/proc/PID/maps		Memory maps to executables and library files.

/proc/PID/mem		Memory held by this process.

/proc/PID/root		Link to the root directory of this process.

/proc/PID/stat		Process status.

/proc/PID/statm		Process memory status information.

/proc/PID/status	Process status in human readable form.



***Files in /proc file system***
File				Description
----				------------
/proc/crypto		list of available cryptographic modules

/proc/diskstats		information (including device numbers) for each of the logical disk devices

/proc/filesystems	list of the file systems supported by the kernel at the time of listing

/proc/kmsg		holding messages output by the kernel

/proc/meminfo		summary of how the kernel is managing its memory

/proc/scsi		information about any devices connected via a SCSI or RAID controller

/proc/tty		information about the current terminals

/proc/version		containing the Linux kernel version, distribution number, gcc version number 				(used to build the kernel) and any other pertinent information relating to the 				version of the kernel currently running


How can we view System Uptime?
$cat /proc/uptime

How can we view system memory information?
$cat /proc/meminfo

How can we view system processor information?
$cat /proc/cpuinfo
