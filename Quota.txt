If you are the only person who uses the disk, there is no need to implement quota at all. 

However if multiple users use the same disk, quotas are the best way to control the individual users from monopolizing entire disk space. 

A user limited by disk quotas cannot use additional disk space beyond his limit. 

For example suppose there are four users; User A, User B, User C, and User D. 

Without quota any user can use the entire disk space, leaving no space for other users.

Implementing a disk quota will prevent users or groups from using too much storage space on a Linux system.

Linux administrators should always put a quota on the maximum storage usage for users, as well as other user environment limits like max number of processes and open files.

How to Install Disk Quota on Linux,
$sudo dnf install disk quota

Using Disk Quota on Linux,
$sudo vi /etc/fstab

/dev/sda1       /home   ext4 defaults,usrquota,grpquota 0 2

Need to remount the file system for the changes to take effect. 
Alternatively, rebooting the system will also work.
$ sudo mount -o remount,rw /home

Let’s create a quota index for the mount point. 
In our case, this would be /home. 
We will include options -c to create a new index, -m so to avoid mounting the partition as read-only, 
and -u to specify that we want to create a quota for users.
$ sudo quotacheck -cmu /home

Turn on the quota:
$ sudo quotaon -v /home

We will use the edquota command to begin putting quotas for individual users.
$ sudo edquota -u linuxconfig

Here is what each column means:
blocks – the number of blocks (1k each) currently used by the user.
soft – the soft maximum number of 1k blocks the user is allowed to use.
hard – the hard maximum number of 1k blocks the user is allowed to use.
inodes – the current number of inodes used by the user.
soft – the soft maximum number of inodes the user is allowed to use.
hard – the hard maximum number of inodes the user is allowed to use.

With our soft and hard limits set, we can control the grace period of our soft limits with the following command:
$ sudo edquota -t

Here are some examples for setting disk quotas and seeing disk quota information on Linux:

Set the disk quota for user linuxconfig:
$ sudo edquota -u linuxconfig /home

Set the disk quota for group developers:
$ sudo edquota -g developers /home

See the current quota settings for user linuxconfig on mount point /home:
$ sudo quota -u linuxconfig /home

Begin enforcing disk quota settings:
$ sudo quotaon -v /home

Turning off disk quotas:
$ sudo quotaoff -v /home

To copy disk quota settings from user linuxconfig1 to user linuxconfig2:
$ sudo edquota -p linuxconfig1 linuxconfig2

***NIS Intro***
Network Information Service

Five daemons are utilized in order to provide the NIS service:

Daemon		Function
------		---------
ypserv		Server process

ypbind		Binding process 

ypxfrd		High-speed map transfer 

rpc.yppasswdd	NIS password update daemon
 
rpc.ypupdated	Modifies other maps such as publickey
