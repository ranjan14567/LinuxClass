The diff command examines two different versions of a file and lists the differences between them. The differences can be stored in a file called a patch file.

The patch command can read a patch file and use the contents as a set of instructions. By following those instructions, the changes in the modified file are replicated in the original file.

diff is the,

-u (unified context)
