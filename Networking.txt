What is a network configuration file in Linux?
#cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<conn-name>

What is a hostname configuration file?
#cat /etc/hostname

Local DNS file,
	/etc/hosts

Check the IP address,
	#ip a 
	#ip addr show
	#ifconfig

#ip link [How many adptor connected to the internet]
	Which link you have to set the IP address.
  i.lo : default
  ii.enp0s3

How to set the hostname?
	#hostnamectl set-hostname hostname

Network Configuration File,
	/etc/syssconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<enp0s3>

How to configure IP address in your machine,
ip address=192.168.10.10
Prefix=24 or Subnetmask=255.255.255.0
gateway=192.168.10.1
dns=8.8.8.8
--------------------------------------------------------
IP Address:Logical address. It's a dynamic means we can change (manually or allocate) keep on change.
----------

IP - Internet Protocol

Two protocol versions of IP: Version 4 and 6. 
An IP Address version 4 (or short IPv4) consists of a 32-bit number. 
An IP Address version 6 (or short IPv6) consists of a 128-bit number.

172.16.254.1  --->IPV4
Total=4 octects , one-one octect =8bit
Ip address range: 0-255
Divided into 2 parts:
	i)Network ID
	ii)HOST ID

There are 5 classes of IP address,
1)CLASS A: Range is 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0 (1-126)
	   Subnetmask: 255.0.0.0
	   Prefix: 8 (1 Octect is 8 Bit)    //Prefix is also call network portion
1st field reserved for "Network ID"

Note:Network ID represents is "1"
     HOST ID represents is "0"

1st field is represent others are 0 (zero) means that is not required for calculate,
255.0.0.0 

Ex:10.10.20.15

2)CLASS B: Range is 128.0.0.0 to 191.0.0.0
           Subnetmask: 255.255.0.0
           Prefix:16
First 2 octect reserved for network portion & remaining 2 are HOST portion.

127.0.0.1 : Reserved for loop back address (Check Network interface card ok or not)

Ex:172.16.5.10

3)CLASS C: Range is 192.0.0.0 to 223.0.0.0
           Sunetmask: 255.255.255.0
           Prefix:24

Three octect are reserved for network portion remaining one reserved HOST portion.

Ex:192.168.60.12

4)CLASS D: Range is 224.0.0.0 to 239.0.0.0
          Used for Multicasting, we are not using.

5)CLASS E: Range is 240.0.0.0 to 255.0.0.0 
          Used for R&D Purpose.

How to set Hostname?
#hostnamectl set-hostname "server.example.com"
#hostname
#ip a

Use "nmcli" command for set the network.
#nmcli c s

#nmcli con modify enp0s3 ipv4.address "192.168.1.40/24"

#nmcli con modify enp0s3 ipv4.gateway "192.168.1.1"

#nmcli con modify enp0s3 ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8"

#nmcli con modify enp0s3 ipv4.method manual

#nmcli con modify enp0s3 connection.autoconnect yes

#nmcli c s

#nmcli c down enp0s3

#nmcli c up enp0s3

C - Connection
S - Show

#ip a     (Now you can get the IP whatever we have provided)

#cat /etc/hosts
192.168.1.40 server2.example.com server2

#ip route  --Network setup Above machine is completed

Where the protocol numbers are stored in Linux?
#cat /etc/protocols

What is the protocol number of ICMP?   "1"

DHCP
----
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a client/server protocol that automatically provides an Internet Protocol (IP) host with its IP address and other related configuration information such as the subnet mask and default gateway.

DNS
---
Domain Name System (DNS)
DNS Server provide computer name-to-IP address mapping name resolution services to computers and users.

Domain Name Service (DNS) numbers are IP addresses that a workstation or server uses to refer to specific servers that resolve domain names to IP addresses.


Gateway
-------
A gateway IP refers to a device on a network which sends local network traffic to other networks.

Router:
------
A router is a networking layer system used to manage and forward data packets to devices network while a gateway is simply a hardware that acts as a gate between the networks. 


Subnet:
-------
Actually a subnet denotes a range of addresses that can be allocated to hosts, such as 192.168.1.0/24 which can accommodate 254 host addresses with one Network address and Broadcast address.

Subnet Mask:
------------
The subnet mask is the classical way of representing which bits are part of the network portion of the address vs. the host bits of the address. 

The subnet mask for a /24 network is 255.255.255.0.

A Subnet mask is a 32-bit value that allows the recipient of IP packets to distinguish the network ID portion of the IP address from the Host ID portion of the address.

Broadcast:
----------
Broadcasting is a method of transferring a message to all recipients.
Broadcast delivers a message to all nodes in the network using a one-to-all association.

Computer Network:
-----------------
A computer network is a group of two or more interconnected computer systems. You can establish a network connection using either cable or wireless media.

Every network involves hardware and software that connects computers and tools.
