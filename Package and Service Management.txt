Service Management:
-------------------
What is service/Daemon ?

 Ans:  A Linux service is an application (or set of applications)/Programs that runs in the background waiting to be used, or carrying out essential tasks.

Sometimes the name of these services or daemons ends with the letter d.
   
   example: sshd,httpd,vsftpd,

 In rhel7 service or daemons known as init scripts file .

 >> To manage(status,start, stop, restart, enable, disable) 

	the services in rhel7 we can use a command called "systemctl" or "service" .


 >> To start, stop and restart a service/daemon is temporary means still server is running .

 >> To enable/disable a servive/daemon is permanent accross reboot .

>> To see available unit types .

  # systemctl -t help 

 Where the unit script file available in rhel7 ? 

 "/usr/lib/systemd/system" 

 # cd /usr/lib/systemd/system/

 #ls *.service

 # ls *.target 
 # ls *.socket

>> How to check  the status of a daemon/service ?

 # systemctl status  <servicename>

 # systemctl status  sshd 
  
   (or)

# service sshd status 

 how to start a service ? 

# systemctl start <ServiceName>
# systemctl start sshd

   (or)

# service sshd start 

How to stop a service ?

 # systemctl stop <ServiceName> .
 # systemctl stop sshd 

   (or)

 # service  sshd stop .

How to restart a service ?

>> Restart a service means stop and start .
 
 # systemctl restart sshd 

 # service sshd restart . 

 >> If a service is enabled/disable mode then temporarly we can start or stop still the session is going on .

 >>  A service enable means accross reboot service will be active no matter before reboot atcive or inactive .

 >> A service disable means accross reboot service will be inactive no matter before reboot active or inactive .

To enable a service . 

 # systemctl enable sshd 

TO disable a service .

 # systemctl disable sshd 

 Note:  Using "service" command we can not enable or disable a service .
        To enable or disable a service permanetly we can use "chkconfig" command .

  ex: 
   
    # chkconfig sshd on (For Enable a service)

    # chkconfig sshd off (For disable service )
