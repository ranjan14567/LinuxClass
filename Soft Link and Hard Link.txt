Link: It is a shortcut or address.
-----

Two types of Link,

1. Soft Link or Symbolink 
---------------------------

	Syntax: ln -s 

	ln: Link
	-s: Soft Link

$vim ankit
Hi
This is my New File
:wq

$cat ankit
Hi
This is my New File

$ln -s /home/Ranjan/ankit /tmp/venkat-slink

/home/Ranjan/ankit -- Source

/tmp/venkat-slink -- Destination

$ls -l ankit /tmp/venkat-slink

stat -- Display file or file system status

$stat ankit

Note: If I do any modification symbolink it would redirect to the main file and vicevrsa.
$vim /tmp/venkat-slink
Hello
:wq

$cd 

$cat ankit

If I delete the main file,
$rm ankit

$ls -l ankit /tmp/venkat-slink
Color is red: No such file or directory called "Dead Link" [No data]

$cat /tmp/venkat-slink
No Such file or Directory

In Soft Link: Different Inode number

2. Hard Link
-------------
Create same file with the inode number.

Inode number = Unique ID

File store in Hard-disk

If you delete main file you can access your data with help of Hard-Link.

Hard-Link means "Copy of Original Files"

$vim elango
Hello This is Elango
:wq

$cat elango

$ln /home/ranjan/elango /tmp/elango-hlink

ln = Hard-Link

/home/ranjan/elango = Source

/tmp/elango-hlink = Destination

$ls -il elango /tmp/elango-hlink

Both Source and Destination Properties are same.
