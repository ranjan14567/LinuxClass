Compression:
------------
Compression: Reducing the size of the actual file size of directory/folder size.

ZIP and GZIP are two very popular methods of compressing files.

1.ZIP is a compression and file packaging utility for Unix.

2.gzip command compresses files. Each single file is compressed into a single file.

GZIP is much better compared to ZIP, in terms of compression, especially when compressing a huge number of files.

Syntax :
zip [options] zipfile files_list

gzip [Options] [filenames]

Syntax for  Creating a zip file:
$zip myfile.zip filename.txt

#gzip <file_name> or gzip -v <file_name>

$unzip myfile.zip

$gunzip <file_name>
