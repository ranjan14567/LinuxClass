What is Storage?
=================
Storage is a mechanism that enables a computer to retain data, either temporarily or permanently.

Storage devices such as flash drives and hard disks are a fundamental component of most digital devices

since they allow users to preserve all kinds of information such as videos, documents, pictures, and raw data.

Hard disks, Floppy diskettes, Tape drives, CD-ROM disks, Memory cards, Cloud drives

External storage devices
========================
External HDDs and SSDs. Flash memory devices. Optical Storage Devices. Floppy Disks. Primary Storage: Random Access Memory (RAM)

Secondary Storage: Hard Disk Drives (HDD) & Solid-State Drives (SSD)
Hard Disk Drives (HDD)

Solid-State Drives (SSD)

>>> In enterprise storage, two concepts are at the core of most conversations: 
Storage area networks (SAN) and Network-attached storage (NAS).

Both options provide storage to clients across a network, which offers the huge benefit of removing individual servers as single points of failure. 

Using one of these options also reduces the cost of individual clients, as there is no longer a need to have large amounts of local storage.

Disk Partitioning:
===============
>>> Partitioning enables you to split your hard drive into multiple parts, where each part acts as its hard drive 

and this is useful when you are installing multiple operating systems on the same machine.

Note: Different types of harddisk are stored under "/dev".

Ex: /dev/sda // 1st sata disk

    /dev/sdb // 2nd stat disk 
    
    /dev/sdc // 3rd sata disk like wise 

    /dev/vda // 1st virtual disk
    
    /dev/vdb // 2nd virtual disk 

>> In a hard disk total we can create 15 partitions.

>> In a hard disk we can create a maximum of 4 primary partitions but the recommended is 3 primary and 1 extended partition.

>> Using Extended partitions we create again more logical partitions.

>> Primary partitions are used to install OS or we can use them to store other data.

	The primary partition ID is "83".

>> Extended partition directly we can not use to store data and id for the extended partition is "5".

>> The logical partition we can use to store data not installing os and id for the logical partition is "83".

>> The partition ID for swap is "82".

>> The partition ID for lvm is "8e".

>> In a raw disk we can not store data unless we apply filesystem.

>> There are different types of filesystem types available in Linux such as.

  ->  ext2 
  ->  ext3
  ->  ext4
  ->  xfs
  ->  swap  // For swap partitioning 
  ->  vfat //This type of filesystem is used in both Windows and Linux.
  ->  btrfs
  ->  iso9660 // To mount iso image we use iso9660 filesystem type .

>> Windows types of the filesystem are:  NTFS, fat32 

>> To manage disk partitioning we can use "fdisk" (or) parted command.

>> To list disk partitioning 

  # fdisk -l  

    (or) 

  # lsblk 

>> To create disk partitioning.

  # fdisk /dev/sdb 

  >type "m" for help 

  >n(create new partition)
  >p (print partition table) 
  >d(to delete partition)
  >q(to quit without saving)
  >w(save and exit)
  >t(to change partition id)

 # partprobe /dev/sdb //To update with kernel


 >> To list disk partition 

 # fdisk -l /dev/sdb 

  (or)

 # lsblk

 >> To apply the filesystem to the disk partition "mkfs" command is used.

 # mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 

 # mkfs -t xfs /dev/sdb2

>> To check whether the filesystem is applied to a disk partition or not "blkid" command is used.

 # blkid // It will list all applied file systems.

  (or)

 # blkid /dev/sdb1    // inidivisually  to check filesystem applied or not 

>> To store data in an applied filesystem we require a mount point and the mount point is any directory under "/" in Linux. 

  # mkdir /redhat 

To mount a filesystem temporarily "mount" command is used
=========================================================

  # mount -t ext4  /dev/sda1  /redhat 

>> To check filesystem is mounted or not.

  # mount // it will list all mounted filesystem 

  # mount | grep -i "/redhat"

       (or) 

  # df -Th // to list all mounted filesystem 


  # df -Th | grep -i "/xyz"

  # cd /redhat 

  # touch file{1..4000}.txt // this files used the filesystem space /dev/sda1 .

>> To unmount the mount point temporary "umount" command is used

 # umount <mountpoint>
 
 #umount /redhat
